# Pente AI with Minimax and Heuristic Evaluation

## üß† About the Project
This repository contains an AI agent implementation for the game **Pente**. The AI uses the **Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning** to evaluate possible moves and make strategic decisions. The heuristic function is designed to:
- **Block** the opponent's opportunities for 3-stone or 4-stone sequences.
- **Prioritize** moves to create its own 3-stone or 4-stone sequences.
- Optimize gameplay performance with efficient board evaluation.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features
- **Minimax Algorithm**: Implements depth-limited search with alpha-beta pruning.
- **Advanced Heuristic Function**: Evaluates board states to detect potential threats and opportunities.
- **Defensive and Offensive Strategies**: Blocks opponent's potential winning moves and sets up AI's own winning paths.
- Configurable board size and depth for customization.
